# Skip Size Page Redesign – React Coding Challenge

## ✨ Objective

Redesign the "Choose Your Skip Size" page from [RemWaste] to look **completely different** from the original while **maintaining the existing functionality**.

This challenge demonstrates my skills in:

- Clean and maintainable React code
- Responsive web design (mobile and desktop)
- Improved UI/UX
- Data rendering from external sources

---

## 🚧 My Approach

### 1. **Research and Inspiration**

- Analyzed the original UI for structure and flow
- Identified weaknesses in the original design (e.g., layout, visual hierarchy, responsiveness)

### 2. **Redesign Goals**

- Use a **fresh visual layout** with better accessibility and spacing
- Improving responsiveness specially across Progress Sidebar, Images
- Ensure smooth interaction across screen sizes
- Improve **visual feedback** (e.g., selection highlights, hover states)
- Present pricing and hire period more clearly

### 3. **Technology Stack**

- ⚛️ React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- 🎨 Styled Components / Tailwind CSS
- 🌍 Fetching data from external API

### 4. **Implementation Plan**

1. Set up the base React project (setup project structure, naming convention and so on)
2. Build a flexible and accessible layout for skip cards
3. Implement API call to dynamically populate skip data
4. Add user interaction: select, highlight, navigation
5. Make responsive adjustments (mobile-first)
6. Final polish with animations or transitions (optional)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first approach for complete layout control
- **Custom Components** – especially a handcrafted Progress Sidebar to demonstrate design skills
- **JavaScript** – kept it clean and fast, avoiding TS unless required
- **State Management:** Maybe using context states only (no need for complex global tools like Redux)
